# Gold Bars

Personal project to track finances across all my accounts.  It tracks many different types of accounts with lots of graphs and visualizations for progress / motivation.

Slowly migrating my existing node.js / mongodb application to this single page app.  I will release a demo page when I complete add / edit of account and transactions.  
Hopefully by the end of Feb 2014

### Technology ###

Runs on a node with Mongodb backend.  Uses flight.js, bootstrap, d3.js and socket.io to make single page app.
 

### ToDo ###

*   Convert css to less
*   Add existing d3 graphs to fixed bottom
*   add top menu
*   add passport authentication
