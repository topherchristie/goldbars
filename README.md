# Gold Bars

Personal project to track finances accross all my accounts.  It tracks all my accounts with lots and lots of graphs and visualizations for progress.  

Slowly migrating my existing node.js / mongodb application to this single page app.  I will release a demo page when I complete add / edit of account and transactions.  
Goal time lime is end of Feb 2014.

### Technology ###

Runs on a node with Mongodb backend.  Uses flight.js, bootstrap, d3.js and socket.io to make single page app.
